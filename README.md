# hello-world
My first repository, huzzah!
I'm looking to see if I can use GitHub for my design work-specially with using images and trying to apply GitHub's handy-dandy version control to those projects. I can definitely empathize with the multiple different names for a file as changes get made. Ctrl+S is my friend.
